/**
 * This class represent the state defined in the games java project and the no.games.chess structure.
 * It implements ChessState from games structure
 * An initial state is created by the AChessGame object when this object is created.
 * It creates an initial state based on the boardpositions from a given ontology game file.
 * The state must be able to return an answer to the question whether this current state is a final state.
 * A final state is either a loss, a win or a draw.
 * A ChessState is characterized by a AgameBoard and positions held in a HashMap.
 * The positions tell which positions are vacant or occupied by a chessPiece. 
 * There exists only one ChessState object, and the values of the state changes only when the .mark method is called.
 * The current state represent the current node in the search tree. Alle the available actions to the state 
 * represent leaves in the search tree.
